Please make a mobile app for small businesses called OnSight. The app is designed to help users track client data and the services the user performed by using geolocation and the amount of time on site to prompt the user to action. Upon signing up, the user should create a [username] and indicate what type of business they run and their [business hours] (for example, a user might say “I’m a landscaper, and I work Monday-Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.). The stated [businesshours] are the times that the app should operate in the background. The app should ask the user permission for location services during [businesshours], noting that the app will run in the background.

The app should then ask the user to input a list of its clients in a field named [client] with their locations in a field named [location]. The app should save this list to a [username_clientdatabase] for later use. 

When using the app during [businesshours], the app will note user location and check it against the [username_clientdatabase] to determine if the user’s location is at a known customer. If the user is at a known location, then the app should add [date], [time], and [duration] to that client’s entry in [username_clientdatabase]. If the user is at an [unknownlocation], then the app should add the [address] of the [unknownlocation], the [date], [time], and [duration] to a new database titled [username_unknownlocation].

At the end of [businesshours], the app should prompt the user with questions based on the information added to [username_clientdatabase]. These questions should ask “You spent [duration] at [client] at [time]. Would you like to generate an invoice for services rendered during that time?” This question should be asked for each of that day’s new entries in [username_clientdatabase], and invoices should be generated as indicated by the [user]. Once those entries are finished, the app should ask the user about that day’s new entries in [username_unknownlocation]. Entries where [duration] is less than 10 minutes should be ignored. The app should ask the following question, using the data collected in [username_unknownlocation]: “You spent [duration] at [address] at [time]. Should this location be added to your client list or ignored?”
